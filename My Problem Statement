Problem Statement No.12 - Agentic AI for Personalized Course Pathways.
---------------------------
The Challenge - Students often struggle to identify the right learning path that aligns with their interests and long-term goals due to the overwhelming number of online courses and a lack of personalized guidance. LearnMate aims to solve this by acting as an Agentic AI coach that interacts with students, understands their interests (like Frontend Development, Cybersecurity, UI/UX Design, etc.), assesses their current skill level, and dynamically builds a personalized course roadmap that adapts over time based on progress and preferences.
